# Lesson 2: Functions and Loop Mastery

In this lesson, I deepened my understanding of Rust by exploring functions and refining my control flow skills. Key topics covered:
- Writing and calling functions, understanding parameters and return values.
- Improving logic with while loops.
- Introducing for loops for more structured iteration.
- Writing cleaner, more efficient, and readable Rust code.

This lesson strengthened my ability to structure programs effectively, setting the stage for more complex concepts ahead.
