# Lesson 3: `mut`, Ownership, and Borrowing

This lesson introduced some of Rust’s core concepts that make it unique in memory safety and concurrency. Key topics covered:
- Understanding `mut` and how to work with mutable variables.
- Exploring Rust’s ownership system and why it prevents memory issues.
- Learning about **borrowing** and the difference between mutable and immutable references.


Grasping these concepts is essential for writing safe and efficient Rust programs, and this lesson marked a significant step in mastering Rust’s memory model.
