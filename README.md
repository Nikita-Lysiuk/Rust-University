# Lesson 4: Strings, Iterators, and `Option<T>`

This lesson focused on working with strings, iterators, and Rust’s `Option<T>` type. Key topics covered: 
- Understanding that Rust strings are UTF-8 encoded and can contain variable-sized characters.
- Using iterators (Iter) to traverse and manipulate strings efficiently.
- Handling optional values with Option<T> to avoid null-related errors.
- Implementing various string-related algorithms:
    - Counting character occurrences.
    - Converting Roman numerals to integers and vice versa.
    - Extracting every second character from a string.
    - Simple encryption by reversing character segments.
    - Formatting names into a business card style.
    - Simulating column-wise addition of large numbers as strings.
    
This lesson provided a deeper understanding of Rust’s powerful string handling and iteration mechanisms, preparing for more advanced text processing techniques.
