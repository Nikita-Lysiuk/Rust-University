# My Education Projects in Rust

This repository documents my journey of learning Rust. Each lesson is stored in a separate branch, reflecting my progress and growing expertise.

## ðŸ“Œ University Course Progress

As part of my university course, Iâ€™ll be sharing my path in Rustâ€”from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics. 

## Lesson 1: The Start of the Journey
The first step into Rust development. In this lesson, I learned:
- How to install Rust and set up Cargo.
- The basics of Rust syntax.
- Core control flow structures: `if`, `while`, and `loop`.
- My first macros: `println!` and `format!`.
- The fundamentals of variable creation and management.

This is just the beginningâ€”each lesson will deepen my understanding of Rust and its capabilities.
