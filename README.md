## Lesson 6: Advanced Iterators and Functional Programming
In this lesson, I explored the power of iterators and functional programming in Rust. The focus was on mastering iterator methods and closures to write concise, expressive, and efficient code. Key topics covered:

- **Iterator Methods:** 
  - Transformation: `map`, `filter`, `enumerate`.
  - Searching: `find`, `findr`.
  - Aggregation: `reduce`, `fold`, `sum`, `min`, `max`.
  - Logical checks: `any`, `all`.
  - Side effects: `for_each`.

- **Closures:** Writing custom logic directly in iterator chains using closures (lambdas).

- **Functional Programming Paradigm:** Combining iterator methods to solve complex problems in a clean and idiomatic way.

This lesson demonstrated how iterators can simplify data processing tasks, making the code more readable and efficient. It also emphasized the importance of functional programming concepts in Rust.
